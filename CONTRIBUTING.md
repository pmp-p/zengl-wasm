# Contributing Features

ZenGL is a minimalist library for the everyday programmer, hobbyist and computer graphic enthusiast.
Providing a comphrehensive, full-featured OpenGL wrapper is a no-goal for this project.
Before implementing a missing feature please file a [Feature Request](https://github.com/szabolcsdombi/zengl/issues) first.

# Contributing Examples

Examples are welcome in many forms.

Please try to adopt the following aspects:

- Assets, even small ones should not be part of the repository.
- Attach assets to the pull request to get them uploaded next to the other asset files.
- GLSL code is not considered an asset file.
- Examples should be self contained single file demos or project like subfolders in the example folder.
- External links to ZenGL examples are also welcome.

Thank you for contributing.
